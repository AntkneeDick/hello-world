First repository ever - Benchmark for my progress

Hello, this is my first GitHub input ever, I hope to look back one year from now and realize how much progress I have made from this point.
I want to improve my coding skills as I believe it will be important in any direction that I decide to go into.
I will be a competent professional and a kind human being.
